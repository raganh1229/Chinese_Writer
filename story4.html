		<p>Hi. My name is Ragan, John Ragan to be exact - but please, call me JR. I'm a third year student who's currently attending Shanghai Jiao Tong University in pursuit of two B.S. in electrical and computer engineering in addition to a B.A. in Chinese language. I began studying Chinese during my junior year of high school and have carried my love and passion for the language into my college career. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, designing websites, and practicing Python, C, and C++. While my current academic path is electrical and computer engineering, I plan on using the latter  degree to focus on a career dedicated to video game development. On this website, you'll find a collection of stories, perspectives, and photographs which illustrate an exchange student's life in Shanghai. Please know, the opinions expressed on this site will portray the cultural, societal, and political differences between China and the United States from my own, personal perspective. This means always highlighting the positives and never sugarcoating the negatives - a process which always results in concrete critical analysis. If you have any questions, concerns, or just want to chat, please feel free to contact me through one of the media platforms directly below. Thank you and enjoy! Hi.
