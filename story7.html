One of the most captivating, yet subtle difference that I’ve noticed here in China is everyone’s infatuation with their cell phone. And when I say everyone, I mean everyone. From infants to eighty-year-old Ayis, there hasn’t been a day in Shanghai where I haven’t been impressed by the technological proficiency of Chinese people across all generations. Typically, in the United States at least, there is quite a large aptitude gap between the older and younger generations regarding tablets, smart phones, and other portable smart devices. It’s quite rare in the U.S. to see those aged seventy or above constantly glued to social media on their phones. Personally, I believe this to be a symptom of China’s determination to construct a cashless society driven by mobile monetary transactions. For those of you who haven’t traveled to China in the past four or five years, it’s important that you know about the prevalence of two, incredibly influential mobile applications: Alipay and WeChat. 
<br>
<br>
Originally released as social media platforms, these applications have taken the country by storm over the recent years – bringing with it a revolutionary new payment system dependent almost entirely on QR codes. Basically, any person who has these apps installed on their devices possesses a QR code unique to them. This code can be linked to that individual’s banking account; allowing them to be scanned for quick and easy payment of goods at locations such as restaurants, barbershops, grocery stores, and elsewhere. The system even allows scanning functionality on each person’s phone – allowing for quick and easy repayment of debts and reimbursements if the need arrives. You would expect this trend to only be prevalent in large cities such as Shanghai, but you’d be wrong. Across my Golden Week journey, I visited many small and isolated villages which have incorporated these payment methods into everyday life. Cash is scarce and debit cards are even scarcer. In China, this is the next generation of monetary transactions. 
<br>
<br>
I believe this is the key reason that has most of the population hooked on their phones. Think about it, every time you go to pay for something, you're simultaneously given the opportunity to check your social media feed for that ever-so-sweet rush of Dopamine. In the United States, this is a bit less prevalent, because the financial system has not taken on this form yet. Social media apps are still separate from any form of banking or financial management application you can download from the app store, providing fewer opportunities for those with less technological experience to accidentally become entangled in social media. 
A second, more cultural reason for this technological phenomenon can be attributed on China’s emphasis on the idea of face, or Guanxi. For those who are unaccustomed to some of the modern norms of Chinese culture, the idea of face can be quite tricky to understand. It’s essentially popularity – popularity amongst one’s peers, coworkers, family, and anyone else in one’s personal sphere. By placing an incredible amount of emphasis on upholding one’s personal image, it has driven modern Chinese society to turn to both technology and materialism to maintain face. Buying expensive clothing, makeup, phones, purses, suits, and many other necessities are essential to further one’s personal status. We have this in the States as well, but on a much smaller scale. 
<br>
<br>
The incentive to exhibit your absolute best on WeChat, the aforementioned social media platform, is exacerbated by the concept of face. Personally, I believe this is the primary reason why older generations have also jumped onto this technological trend – to keep their status and popularity through a convenient technological outlet. This “modern-fad” is something I can understand. Something I cannot however, is the older generation’s inclination to exchange a traditional Chinese lifestyle for one popularized by the country's youth. You see, cell phones aren't the only goods that have captivated younger and older generations by storm. The emphasis on a more consumerist society fueled by the country’s booming economy has entangled all generations within Chinese society, including those who lived through the sixties and seventies. It’s quite interesting really, seeing people aged seventy and older sporting brands such as Converse, Adidas, and Supreme. There’s never been a time that I’ve visited Nanjing Road, The Bund, or any side-street in downtown Shanghai and haven't seen an elderly Chinese individual sporting the latest Nike joggers. Perhaps that’s the key – maybe this trend is only kept alive in China’s megacities where progress is the norm and older traditions are gradually fading. Even if this is the case, this pattern differs drastically from older generations who inhabit some of the largest cities in the U.S., many of whom frequently adorn more conservative clothing styles.
<br>
<br>
Please keep in mind that these are simply my assumptions as to why modernism has gripped such a wide-spectrum of generations within China – they are by no means grounded in fact. Regardless, I hope it gave you some insight as to why that seventy-year-old Ayi sitting next to you on the subway is sporting the latest iPhone and the newest pair of Yeezys on the market.
