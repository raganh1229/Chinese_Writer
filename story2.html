<p>1.) 了 – A model particle. It indicates that an action has occurred. It can appear either after a verb or at the end of a sentence. When it appears after a verb, it signals the occurrence of an action. There is usually a time phrase in the sentence.
<br>
Note: Immediately use after action.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Use 1.) Indicate a past action.
<br>
Ex.) 昨天我去对体育馆游泳。
<br>
Yesterday I went to swim in the gym.
<br>
Ex.) 我看了他的车。
<br>
I saw his car.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Use 2.) Notice that 了 is not the equivalent of the past tense. The action can take place in the future.
<br>
Ex.) 明天我会去了火车站。
<br>
Tomorrow I will go to the train station.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Use 3.) Sometimes there isn’t a time phrase in the sentence. The time implied is “just now” or “up till now.”
<br>
Ex.) 你买我们的票了吗？
<br>
Did you buy our tickets?
<br>
Ex.) 我买了。
<br>
I bought them.
<br>
Ex.) 等了多张时间？
<br>
Did you wait a long time?
<br>
Answer.) 人不多，只等了五分钟。
<br>
There were not a lot of people. I only waited five minutes.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Use 4.) If there is an object after the verb and 了, the object is usually quantified. Under certain circumstances, the object need not be quantified in any way.
<br>
Note: Used to remove the quantities of certain objects.
<br>
Ex.) 我买了票就回来家了。
<br>
I bought one ticket then returned home.
<br>
Ex.) 我给你打了电话了。
<br>
I have you a phone call.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Use 5.) When 了 occurs at the end of a sentence, it may signify a new situation, some kind of change, or the occurrence or realization of an event or state.
<br>
Note: Used to indicate a changing scenario.
<br>
Ex.) 十月了，天气慢慢冷了。
<br>
It’s October. The weather is gradually getting colder.
<br>
Ex.) 我想今天晚上看电话，可是明天要考试，所以不看了。
<br>
I wanted to go see a movie tonight, but I have an exam tomorrow, so I cannot see it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Use 6.) When there are two verb phrases in a sentence and the first verb phrase is followed by the particle 了，the two actions denoted by the verbs are consecutive. The second action begins when the first one is completed.
<br>
Ex.) 我下了课再去找你。
<br>
I’ll look for you after class.
<br>
Ex.) 昨天般进了宿舍就去餐厅吃饭了。
<br>
Yesterday I finished moving into my dorm, then I went to eat at the cafeteria.
