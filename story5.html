If you know me in person you probably know that I love food. I’m originally from Louisiana, my mother is half Italian, both of my grandmothers have published their own cookbooks, and my dad can make one hell of a microwaveable meal. For most of my life I’ve been raised on a combination of Italian and Cajun cuisine that outmatches most other food on this planet – and trust me, I’ve tried a lot of it. To top it all off, I’ve lived in Asheville, North Carolina for the past five years, a city widely known for having some of the best local food in the state.
<br>
<br>
Keeping that in mind, it’s important to know that when I first learned I’d be traveling to China in the fall semester, my excitement levels to finally taste the cuisines I had learned so much about in class were off the chart. My teachers and professors have always boasted about the legendary spiciness of Sichuan style foods, the succulent meats of Shandong province, and the tasty array of breads that can be found in Beijing. Legendary dishes such as mapo doufu, hotpot, baozi, jiaozi, song shu yu, and la mian tiao were supposed to knock my socks off. The problem is – they haven’t. 
<br>
<br>
Let me explain. I’m not saying Chinese food is bad. As a matter of fact, I quite enjoy many of the meals I’ve eaten here in China, with Shanghai styled foods being my absolute favorite. The reason I stand by my statement is because, well, exactly what it says – no Chinese food has presented enough flavor or uniqueness to blow my mind.
<br>
<br>
I think a large reason for this has to do with the fact that I’m from the United States – one of the only countries in the world where almost every food choice is over saturated with flavor. Chocolate, burgers, cake, pizza, hot dogs, sweet and sour chicken, sour candies, burritos, tacos, chicken fried steak, chicken fried chicken – the list could go on and on. The point I’m trying to make is, once you’ve consumed food in the U.S., you really begin to recognize how out of line your flavor tolerance is once you’ve switched over to a diet consisting of rice with small side dishes of meat, tofu, and broth.
<br>
<br>
Testing and trying new foods is another large contributor to this lack of amazement with Chinese cuisine. You see, I place the dishes I’ve tried thus far into two basic categories: foods I’ve liked and foods I don’t. In China, you’ve got to be adventurous and try everything you see to get a good sense of the meals you want to eat on a daily basis. Such a daring journey however, can lead to some very surprising and negative experiences when you begin eating things in which you don’t know their origin. While my Mandarin skills are seemingly proficient, being able to identify every ingredient on a food package is an impossible task. This issue is only heightened by the widespread use of calligraphic fonts used on food containers here. Long story short, I’ve enjoyed some very yummy Chinese foods from taste tastings. Others, on the other hand, have ruined my appetite for the rest of the day. This is to be expected from a country with a food palette so different from the cuisine of my home. Because of my passion to experience as many Chinese foods as possible, the two categories listed above have filled up quite evenly, leaving me with a very neutral opinion of Chinese food as a whole.
<br>
<br>
One genre of Chinese cuisine that I have grown an affinity for however, is the country's large variety of candies and sweets. Since experiencing the Mid-Autumn Festival last September, I’ve grown quite fond of one of the nation’s favorite sweet snacks, moon cakes. These treats can also be made salty, often filled with a variety of meats that make it very reminiscent of a meat pie – a local favorite among Louisiana folk. My favorite type however, is usually filled with a sweet red bean paste, allowing for the perfect combination of chewy and sweet to completely overtake your taste buds. Additionally, China’s famous milk and fruit teas have left me with a small addiction to tapioca pearls and gelatin. These two ingredients are often placed at the bottom of the two sweet concoctions, each of which contains an additional mixture of red tea, sweetened milk, and sugar. To say it’s delicious is an understatement. 
<br>
<br>
And please, don’t be fooled, some of the main courses I’ve had here in China are quite delicious as well. Hotpot is among one of the favorite things I’ve tried despite its high price. The numbing sensation of peppercorns combined with an abundance of meats, tofu, vegetables, and noodles saturated in hot chili oil makes for an incredibly sweaty, yet delicious meal. Another favorite of mine is what I like to call “build-a-bowl noodles.” Essentially, you pick out a variety of vegetables, tofu, meat, noodles, and mushrooms to put into a giant bowl. The cashier weighs this bowl of goodies, charges you, and then sends it back to the chef to have the ingredients prepared in a spicy broth. The result is a delicious bowl of spicy goodness that will leave you full and satisfied. Other favorites are of course Shandong sautéed eggplant, baozi (steamed buns filled with meats, vegetables, and even bean paste), and most importantly, jiaozi (steamed Chinese dumplings). 
<br>
<br>
Some other important aspects of China’s food culture doesn’t have anything to do with the taste, style, or flavor of the dishes. Price, for example is a very big positive in most Chinese restaurants. You can often walk into a restaurant in Shanghai and order a large portion of rice, meat, bread, and vegetables for approximately three dollars – a meal that would normally cost around twenty at your local Chinese restaurant in the States. If you go out looking for western-styled foods however, you will likely pay prices similar to those in the U.S., if not more. Additionally, the primary types of macronutrients found in Chinese foods are carbohydrates and fats. This makes the meals extremely filling and very good for sleep, but often at the cost of healthy eating. Protein is a bit tricky to find if you don’t have access to a personal kitchen, as meat is often served in small portions at restaurants. If you’re looking to meet your daily requirements however, I highly recommend eating peanuts or boiled eggs – both of which are cheap and readily available for purchase at almost any convenient store in the city. 
<br>
<br>
When it comes to eating in China, it can be a fun and exciting adventure. Whether or not you will love the food is for you to decide. I have many friends who would take traditional Chinese foods over meals found in the U.S. any day of the week. Please keep in mind however, that the most important thing to remember when trying food in China is safety. There’s a boatload of red flags you need to watch for before eating at a restaurant or street vendor. This is primarily because health and safety standards aren’t always up to par with food found in the States. Before traveling to China, I highly advise doing your research on what to look for so that you don’t get sick while enjoying your time abroad.
