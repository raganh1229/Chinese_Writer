		<p>The end of my first week here in China is quickly approaching, so I believe it’s necessary that I reflect on the experiences I’ve encountered thus far to facilitate personal growth.
Please note, these entries are my personal opinions regarding the differences between the regularly practiced customs in the United States and those prevalent on the other side of the Pacific. 
<br>
<br>
The intended purpose of this blog is to provide some insight into the various differences one might experience while studying abroad in China. As the first student to take part in the SJTU - NCSU joint program, I believe it's important to inform prospective NCSU students about what they can expect from their semester abroad in Shanghai before committing to study here. In addition to some of my personal stories, you can expect to see a catalog of grammatical structures that reflect the teachings of my Chinese language course throughout the semester.
<br>
<br>
I highly encourage anyone that reads this blog to research these topics for themselves and formulate their own opinions based on their findings. With that being said, please take from these excerpts what you will and use them to further your knowledge of Chinese culture from an American’s perspective. Thank you.</p>
