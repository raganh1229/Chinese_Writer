Education in China is tough. From kindergarten to high school, students are highly motivated to study hard in order to perform well on the country’s highly-competitive college entrance examination and get accepted into a high-ranking university. One would think that after out-competing a population of nearly ten million and gaining entrance into one of the country’s top institutions, the academic pressure would lessen significantly. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn’t, I have no idea. The scenario I just described is not my personal experience. As an exchange student, I never had to hone my academic skills to such a precise level to be accepted into Shanghai Jiao Tong. I certainly didn’t have to spend countless hours buried in books during my high school years to score well on the SAT and get accepted into NC State. 
<br>
<br>
What I can speak on however, is the difference between the levels of academic rigor in a Chinese university and my home institution. Personally, I don’t believe the engineering courses taught here in China are harder because of their content. I believe they’re harder because of the pace and form in which the content is distributed. Let me explain. Throughout my time in high school and my first two years of college, most of my mathematics, physics, and engineering courses were primarily taught using countless numbers of examples to explain the methodology behind a concept or theorem. On the daily, professors would work practice problem after practice problem to reinforce the content that was taught to us in class. Here in China, it appears to the be the exact opposite. Seldom are examples worked out by the professors in the classrooms. Theorems and their proofs are the main way in which knowledge is distributed - a process that takes way less time than working out examples illustrating the application of a concept after it’s initially taught. A lack of examples typically leaves more time in a normal class period for a professor to teach more theorems and proofs, leaving all the time-consuming, nitty-gritty problem solving for the students to undergo on their own. This in turn, leads to less free time, a drastic increase in homework quantities, and an all-around heightened level of stress. 
<br>
<br>
Personally, I prefer the teaching methods employed by my professors in the United States over those used in China. This isn’t because one set of techniques is better than the other, but rather that I’ve always learnt best through examples and have always walked away quite confused by abstract mathematical proofs. 
A funny example of the dilemma mentioned above comes from my intermediate circuits course currently being taught here at SJTU. Within the first week of class, nearly four chapters of our first textbook were covered. Rarely have examples been provided, as expected. The Monday of the second week, the professor took a poll by show of hands, asking the class of approximately one-hundred fifty students whether they would like to focus on learning new proofs or examples of the subjects already covered. Three students raised their hands asking for more proofs. More than one-hundred voted to step back and cover the past material further. To his complete surprise, the instructor let out a solemn sigh over the hushed microphone followed by ten seconds of silence. Then came his reply, “More proofs it is then.” My mouth dropped open. It was quite comical, really – akin to something you’d see in a Seinfeld episode. My friends Brayden and Andrew dropped the class the next day.
<br>
<br>
My advice to anyone looking to study abroad at Shanghai Jiao Tong is this: reduce the level of technical classes you would normally take by one or two if you can afford to do so. You won’t regret it. I certainly didn’t. This will allow you a reasonable amount of engineering work while also giving you enough free time to experience everything China has to offer. Substitute one of those engineering classes with lectures that provide some insight into Chinese culture such as a philosophy or language course. These might count as a general education credit at your home institution. 
<br>
<br>
Don’t let the differences in education between the United States and China intimidate you. The content isn’t harder, just taught differently. The differences are merely cultural and reflect teaching and learning styles that are widespread in China, but seldom seen in United States.
